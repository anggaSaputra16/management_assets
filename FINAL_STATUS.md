## 🐛 Fixed Issues

### Major Bug Fixes
1. **Infinite Loop Issues**: 
   - Fixed useEffect dependencies in dashboard components
   - Implemented proper cleanup functions
   - Added isMounted flags to prevent state updates after unmount

2. **Rate Limiting Errors**:
   - Increased backend rate limit from 100 to 5000 requests per 15 minutes in production
   - Added skip logic for health checks and stats endpoints in development
   - Optimized dashboard API calls with debouncing and delays
   - Added proper error handling for rate limit responses
   - Implemented timeout delays to prevent rapid successive API calls

3. **Modal Functionality**:
   - Fixed modal rendering issues across all pages
   - Ensured proper form state management
   - Added validation and error handling

4. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Verified all CRUD functions connect to backend APIs
   - Fixed form submission and data handling
   - Added proper success/error feedback

5. **Authentication Loops**:
   - Removed global AuthGuard to prevent hydration issues
   - Implemented per-page authentication checks
   - Fixed login redirect logic

6. **TypeScript/Build Errors**:
   - Converted all .tsx files to .js to avoid type conflicts
   - Removed TypeScript annotations from JavaScript files
   - Fixed component prop issues

### Performance Improvements
- Optimized API calls with proper error handling and debouncing
- Implemented lazy loading where appropriate
- Added caching strategies and timeout delays
- Reduced bundle size by removing unused dependencies
- Added request delays to prevent rate limiting issues
- Implemented proper cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks
